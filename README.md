# 310-demos

This is a collection of short lecture demos I wrote as part of my TA responsibilities for ECE 310, Digital Signal Processing.
Each lecture demo is written with the purpose of providing a graphical visual model of a more abstract lecture topic, then showcasing some practical extensions of the topic. They also give the students insight into how to represent abstract topics in code in a high-level scripting language.

# Topics

* Week 2: z-transform, poles and zeros, inverse z-transform
* Week 4: Fourier transform, discrete-time Fourier transform, sinusoidal signals 
* Week 8: Discrete Fourier transform, spectral analysis
